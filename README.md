## Overview

  An excellent challenge from Frontend Mentor, where I could practice my Javascript skills and learn some concepts of working with arrays and DOM. In this challenge I used the Tailwind CSS framework to help me build a responsive layout and optimize my workflow. I also used NPM and JS to install tailwind and configure its dependencies.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser (Not done)

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

  In this project I practiced DOM manipulation with Javascript and I was able to learn important array methods, which I believe that will be important in future challenges and projects. In the future I would like to be able to solve more complex problems that include DOM manipulation and working with arrays. This was my first Frontend Mentor challenge done and I hope it won't be the last.
